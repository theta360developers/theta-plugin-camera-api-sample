## Specification of this plugin
* This plug-in capture still and video by using [Camera API](https://api.ricoh/docs/theta-plugin-reference/camera-api/), [AudioManager API](https://api.ricoh/docs/theta-plugin-reference/audio-manager-api/) and [PluginLibrary](https://github.com/ricohapi/theta-plugin-sdk/tree/master/pluginlibrary) for RICOH THETA V. This plug-in has been made as an example to show the way of using Camera API for RICOH THETA V.
* After capturing still or video, the JPEG or MP4+WAV file is stored in /sdcard/DCIM/ folder.
* The stored file name is "yyyyMMddHHmmss".jpg (.mp4 or .wav for video). "yyyyMMddHHmmss" is 20180123123456 when it is 12:34:56 Jan 23, 2018.
* WebAPI can not be used when Camera API is used.
* The .wav file includes 4ch spatial audio as a first-order ambisonics B-format.
* The .mp4 file includes 4K video and 1ch monaural audio.
* The metadata of the files (.mp4 and .jpg) which outputted by using CameraAPI will be missed than the case of using WebAPI. (We recommend to use WebAPI instead of CameraAPI.)
